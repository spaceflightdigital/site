>This site is developer focused. For a holistic overview of the product you should go to [NationBuilder.com](https://www.nationbuilder.com). 

You can think of NationBuilder as a combo of CRM, CMS, and email platform (those are the three biggest pillars of the product).

NationBuilder sites are powered by the [Liquid markup language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). So where you might use PHP on WordPress, on NB you'd instead use Liquid.

When you build a site, native page types (think, "post" in WordPress, but more of them) are action-oriented and feed info back to the CRM. From there you can use that info to auto-send emails from the platform.

Already that integration is pretty sweet out of the box - no connecting various plugins or managing third party platforms for different use-cases.
