You should use NationBuilder for a campaign/website that has a need for the following features (aside from email marketing, and fully integrated CRM):

- [Signup Forms]()
- [Donations](https://nationbuilder.com/how_to_create_a_donation_page) (accept payments securely)
- [Petitions](https://nationbuilder.com/how_to_create_a_petition) (think Change.org)
- [Surveys](https://nationbuilder.com/how_to_create_a_survey) (think Typeform)
- [Events](https://nationbuilder.com/setting_up_an_event) (think Eventbrite)
- [Leaderboard](https://nationbuilder.com/how_to_create_a_leaderboard) (every action someone takes on a site assigns them points, they are tracked and ranked here)
- [Volunteer Recruitment](https://nationbuilder.com/how_to_volunteer) (track recruits and the tasks they've opted to do)
- & a bunch of others you can check out [here](https://nationbuilder.com/types_of_nationbuilder_pages)

**The best way to make the most of these NationBuilder features (from a development perspective), is to actually use them.**

**Create a fully action-focused website, track user engagement via the CRM and schedule emails to keep supporters engaged. Otherwise just stick with Wordpress.**
